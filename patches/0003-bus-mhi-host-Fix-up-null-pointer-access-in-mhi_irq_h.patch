Subject: [PATCH 03/14] bus: mhi: host: Fix up null pointer access in
 mhi_irq_handler

The irq handler for a shared IRQ ought to be prepared for running
even now it's being freed. So let's check the pointer used by
mhi_irq_handler to avoid null pointer access since it is probably
released before freeing IRQ.

Fixes: 1227d2a20cd7 ("bus: mhi: host: Move IRQ allocation to controller registration phase")
