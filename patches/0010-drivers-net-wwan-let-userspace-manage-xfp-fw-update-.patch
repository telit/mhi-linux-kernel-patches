Subject: [PATCH 10/13] drivers: net: wwan: let userspace manage xfp fw update
 states

The heuristic for detecting firmware upgrade does not work well.

Let userspace manage firmware upgrade start and stop by writing
to the fw_update sysfs file.

The firmware update process consists of these steps:

- Disable runtime power management on the mhi pci device
- Write 1 to the fw_update sysfs file to races between
  the recovery work and other mhi operations
- Start the firmware update
- Write 0 to the fw_update sysfs file to reset the mhi stack

Firmware update requires also upstream commit
